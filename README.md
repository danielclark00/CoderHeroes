# CoderHeroes

Welcome to CoderHeroes, the premier learning platform that empowers kids to learn how to code. Their mission is to incubate tech skills within underserved school districts, and do this through their innovative BUY-ONE-GIVE-ONE CHARITABLE MODEL. With every purchase of the platform, it is not only empowering a child with essential tech skills, but also directly contributing to our mission.

They believe that every child should have access to the tools and resources necessary to succeed in today's digital age. That's why they are committed to providing top-quality coding education to all children, regardless of their background or circumstances.

I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the team that built the backend of their platform. Working alongside a talented group of individuals was truly fulfilling, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the project.
